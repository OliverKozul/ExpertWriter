    FAQ:
      - title: Aligning References with the Chosen Style Guide
        description: >-
          This service involves ordering the entries correctly (alphabetically, by year, number of authors, etc.) and formatting each entry to the currently used style, while marking the missing elements in yellow (these will always have to be completed by the client).
      - title: Converting References to a Different Style Guide
        description: >-
          This service again involves ordering the entries correctly (alphabetically, by year, number of authors, etc.) and formatting each entry to the requested style guide (if not one of the standard formats, examples will have to be provided by the client) while marking the missing elements in yellow (these will always have to be completed by the client).
          
      - title: Editing Certificate
        description: >-
          An editing certificate will be issued upon request to those that need to confirm to the publishers that their work has been professionally edited. 
      - title: Plagiarism and AI Score Reduction
        description: >-
        While this service is not provided by Expert Writer, those that run their work through appropriate software can submit the report based on which the problematic text will be paraphrased (priced at 0.05-0.07 EUR per word, on a case-by-case basis depending on the extent of rewriting needed) and can run the software again to see the level of reduction achieved in the edited version.

    title2: Transparent Pricing
    description2: Before starting any project, the required editing level is determined based on the quality of the original text. This, along with the project urgency (normal or rush delivery) and word count, will determine the cost. The price and deadline quoted to the client is never altered, making it easy to budget for your editing needs.
    title3: Firm Deadlines
    description3: Once the project deadline is confirmed, it is never breached, as the aim is to deliver the work even faster without compromising on the quality.
    title4: Consistently High Quality 
    description4: All edited documents meet the language standards expected by renowned peer-reviewed journals and are certified by the British academic editor with extensive experience in the industry.
